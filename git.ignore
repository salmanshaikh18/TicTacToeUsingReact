React Icons
npmâ€ƒtravis ci

Include popular icons in your React projects easily with react-icons, which utilizes ES6 imports that allows you to include only the icons that your project is using.

Installation (for standard modern project)
npm install react-icons --save
Usage
import { FaBeer } from 'react-icons/fa';
class Question extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h3> Lets go for a <FaBeer />? </h3>
  }
}
Installation (for meteorjs, gatsbyjs, etc)
If your project grows in size, this option is available. This method has the trade-off that it takes a long time to install the package. Suitable for MeteorJS, Gatsbyjs etc.

npm install @react-icons/all-files --save
Usage
import { FaBeer } from "@react-icons/all-files/fa/FaBeer";
class Question extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h3> Lets go for a <FaBeer />? </h3>
  }
}
